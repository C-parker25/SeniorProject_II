# Class Matters: STEM Like ME E-Commerce Expansion
## Project Overview 
Class Matters is a character-developing STEM organization that provides life skills to underrepresented students. The organization's core mission revolves around "self-sustainment." This project aims to expand the existing website (class-matters.org) by adding an e-commerce component to allow Dr. Lamkin, our client, to sell STEM-related products for students. Additionally, this expansion will include donation tracking, ensuring automatic receipt generation for improved record-keeping.
