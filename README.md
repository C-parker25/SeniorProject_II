# Class Matters: STEM Like ME E-Commerce Expansion
## Project Overview 
Class Matters is a character-developing STEM organization that provides life skills to underrepresented students. The organization's core mission revolves around "self-sustainment." This project aims to expand the existing website (class-matters.org) by adding an e-commerce component to allow Dr. Lamkin, our client, to sell STEM-related products for students. Additionally, this expansion will include donation tracking, ensuring automatic receipt generation for improved record-keeping.

Html pages are under templates\core
Add URL to core\urls_add.py (meant for additional urls so that we do not touch the main file)
     whenever creating new html file. this is under ecomprj\core
Django naturally creates test.py so add all unit test to that file.
